The LCR group is always exploring the use of new technologies to advance our research. Some of the current platforms we utilize within our group include:

* **Illumina MiSeq for next-generation sequencing**

* **Nanostring nCounter for gene expression analysis**

  Nanostring's nCounter technology allows us to utilize our large repository of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET) for exploring gene expression analysis in primary samples and cell lines.
  
  Some selected publications from the LCR group that have used this technology include:
  
  * ["Cell of origin of transformed follicular lymphoma"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26307535), Blood 2015
  * ["Prognostic Significance of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Cell of Origin Determined by Digital Gene Expression in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissue Biopsies"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26240231), Journal of Clinical Oncology 2015

* **CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing**

* **Fluorescence *in situ* hybridization (FISH) assays**

  We utilize FISH assays such as break-apart and dual-fusion approaches in many studies within the LCR group.
  
  * ["Comprehensive characterization of programmed death ligand structural rearrangements in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27268263), Blood 2016
  * ["Genomic Alterations in CIITA Are Frequent in Primary Mediastinal Large B Cell Lymphoma and Are Associated with Diminished MHC Class II Expression"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26549456), Cell Reports 2015
  * ["Recurrent genomic rearrangements in primary testicular lymphoma"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25712539), Journal of Pathology 2015

We also work closely with other researchers at the BC Cancer Agency and the [Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://www.bcgsc.ca/). These collaborations allow us to generate data using many additional technologies including:

* **Illumina HiSeq and NextSeq**

* **10X Genomics Chromium**

* **Proteomics (mass spectrometry)**
