The LCR group is always exploring the use of new technologies to advance our research. Some of the current platforms we utilize within our group include:

* **Illumina MiSeq for next-generation sequencing**

* **NanoString nCounter for gene expression analysis [(tag)](/tags/nanostring/)**

  NanoString's nCounter technology allows us to utilize our large repository of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET) for exploring gene expression analysis in primary samples and cell lines.

* **CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing**

* **Fluorescence *in situ* hybridization (FISH) assays [(tag)](/tags/FISH/)**

  We utilize FISH assays such as break-apart and dual-fusion approaches in many studies within the LCR group.

We also work closely with other researchers at the BC Cancer Agency and the [Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://www.bcgsc.ca/). These collaborations allow us to generate data using many additional technologies including:

* **Illumina HiSeq and NextSeq**

* **10X Genomics Chromium**

* **Proteomics (mass spectrometry)**
