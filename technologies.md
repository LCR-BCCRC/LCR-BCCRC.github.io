The LCR group is always exploring the use of new technologies to advance our research. Some of the current platforms we utilize within our group are:

* Illumina MiSeq for next-generation sequencing
* Nanostring nCounter for gene expression analysis

We also work closely with other researchers at the BC Cancer Agency and the [Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://www.bcgsc.ca/). These collaborations allow us to generate data using many additional technologies including:

* Illumina HiSeq and NextSeq
* 10X Genomics Chromium
* Proteomics (mass spectrometry)
