[Prognostic Model to Predict Post-Autologous Stem-Cell Transplantation Outcomes in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma](http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.72.7925). Chan, FC, et al. Journal of Clinical Oncolocy, 2017.
  * Development of RHL30, a prognostic model that uses relapse biopsies in cHL to identify patients that will respond poorly to ASCT

[Genetic profiling of MYC and BCL2 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma determines cell-of-originâ€“specific clinical impact](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/129/20/2760.long). Ennishi, D, et al. Blood, 2017.
  * Using SNP arrays, this study showed that *MYC* and *BCL2* genetic alterations are dependent on cell of origin subtype, and that *BCL2* mutations are significantly associated with inferior survival in R-CHOP treated patients

[The impact of dual expression of MYC and BCL2 by immunohistochemistry on the risk of CNS relapse in DLBCL](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/early/2016/01/29/blood-2015-10-676700?sso-checked=true). Savage, K, et al. Blood, 2016.
  * This work demonstrates that DLBCLs with expression of both MYC and BCL2 by IHC have a poorer outcome after treatment with R-CHOP
