Computational biology in the LCR department is performed by the [bioinformatics team]({{ site.url }}/personnel.html).

Some of the main tasks we perform include:

* **Pipeline Development**

  We strive to create reproducible and well-documented analysis pipelines for use within and outside the group. We currently develop our pipelines using GNU Makefiles, and are now exploring the use of high-level pipelining tools. 
  
* **Lymphoma sample database** 

  Thanks to the generosity of patients and their families, the LCR department has access to a large repository of lymphoma tissue for research purposes. A major focus is the organization and tracking of these samples, and we are working to develop a robust database to accomplish this task.
